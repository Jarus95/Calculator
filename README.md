# MyCalculator v2.0

This is an improved version **[v1.0](https://github.com/Jarus95/Calculator/tree/releases/v1.0)**


This project shows how I can successfully use data types &amp; arithmetic operations

Have a look at `Program.cs` file and you can see how I have used:

* Console input/output
* Conversion between data types
* Arithmetic operations 
* Logical operation (if else, switch case expression)
* Loop operations
* The try-catch statement
* Classes
* Inheritence
* Polymorphism 
* Interfaces
